# 🤖📚 RAG Chatbot Project
Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot project! This project is designed to build a chatbot that can respond accurately to queries using information from your documents and data sources, rather than solely relying on pre-trained knowledge.

**🚀 Project Overview**
This project explores two main topics:

**- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** This powerful application retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset to enhance response quality and relevance.

**- Chatbot Development:** Build a custom chatbot that generates responses based on the information within your specific documents and data sources.

**📂 Project Structure**

**- Data Loading:** Scripts and utilities for loading documents using LangChain’s loaders.

**- Data Splitting:** Code to handle document splitting and preprocessing.

**- Vector Store:** Scripts for embedding documents and storing vectors for efficient retrieval.

**- Retrieval:** Code for querying and accessing relevant data from the vector store.

**- Chatbot:** Main logic for conversational flow and handling user interactions.

**🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used**

**- LangChain:** Framework for creating LLM applications with powerful data handling capabilities.

**- Python Libraries:** For building the chatbot and managing data flow.

**- Vector Stores:** Essential for embeddings and effective retrieval of contextual data.
