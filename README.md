# ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š RAG Chatbot Project
Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot project! This project is designed to build a chatbot that can respond accurately to queries using information from your documents and data sources, rather than solely relying on pre-trained knowledge.

**ðŸš€ Project Overview ðŸš€**
This project explores two main topics:
**- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** This powerful application retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset to enhance response quality and relevance.

**- Chatbot Development:** Build a custom chatbot that generates responses based on the information within your specific documents and data sources.

**Project Structure ðŸ“‚**
**data_loading:** Scripts and utilities for loading documents using LangChainâ€™s loaders.

**data_splitting:** Code to handle document splitting and preprocessing.

**vector_store:** Scripts for embedding documents and storing vectors for efficient retrieval.

**retrieval:** Code for querying and accessing relevant data from the vector store.

**chatbot:** Main logic for conversational flow and handling user interactions.
